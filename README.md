# Graph as Tree 

## Description

This project contains implementations of a **Graph structured as a Tree** in **Go**, **Python**, and **Java**. The graph behaves like a tree (no cycles, hierarchical structure) and allows creating nodes with multiple child connections.

This project is designed for understanding tree-like structures in graph theory across multiple programming languages.

## Features

- Graph structure behaving as a tree
- Supports adding child nodes to any node
- Implemented in:
  - Go (`graph.go`)
  - Python (`graph.py`)
  - Java (`graphs.java`)
- Easy-to-understand class/struct-based logic
- Extensible for traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS, etc.)

---

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: Structs, Slices
- **Python**: Classes, Lists
- **Java**: Classes, ArrayLists
